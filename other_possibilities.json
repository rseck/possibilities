  "prompt": "Task: Rephrase Text 1 to Alter the Answer to a Multiple-Choice Question\n\nYou are given a premise (Text 1) and a hypothesis (Text 2), and asked to determine the relationship between the two texts by selecting one of three options: entailment, neutral, or contradiction.\n\nInstructions:\nStep 1: Answer the Original Question\nRead both Text 1 (premise) and Text 2 (hypothesis).\nThen, answer the question: \"What is the relationship between Text 1 and Text 2?\"\nThe possible answers are:\n\nEntailment: Text 1 logically implies Text 2.\nNeutral: Text 1 and Text 2 are unrelated, neither supporting nor contradicting each other.\nContradiction: Text 1 contradicts Text 2.\nStep 2: Modify Text 1 to Change the Answer\nAfter determining the original relationship, rephrase or modify elements of Text 1 to change the answer to one of the other two options.\nFor each of the other two possible answers (entailment, neutral, contradiction):\n\nIdentify what needs to be changed in Text 1 to achieve the alternative relationship.\nRephrase Text 1 accordingly.\nStep 3: Explain the Changes\nFor each rephrased version of Text 1, explain why the change you made results in the new relationship between the texts.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Question: \"What is the relationship between Text 1 and Text 2?\"\n\nText 1 (Premise): \"A yellow car drives across a snowy path.\"\nText 2 (Hypothesis): \"A red car is driving on a sunny day.\"\nOriginal Answer: \"Contradiction\"\n(Explanation: The colors of the cars and the weather conditions differ.)\n\nStep 2: Rephrase to Achieve Other Relationships:\n\nTo Change the Answer to 'Entailment':\n\nRevised Text 1: \"A red car is driving on a sunny day.\"\nExplanation: The car color and the weather conditions are now the same, so Text 1 entails Text 2.\nTo Change the Answer to 'Neutral':\n\nRevised Text 1: \"A yellow car is parked in a garage.\"\nExplanation: The new premise does not contradict or support Text 2. It describes a completely unrelated event, so the relationship becomes neutral.\n"
