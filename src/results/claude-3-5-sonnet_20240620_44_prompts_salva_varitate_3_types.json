Text 1 states that Jamie wants to meet his mom, which implies he is looking for her.\n2. Text 1 also reveals that Jamie's mom is Julia Raskin.\n3. However, Text 1 explicitly states that Jamie doesn't know his mom's name.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the answer is:\n\nFalse\n\nExplanation: While it's true that Jamie is looking for his mom, and his mom is indeed Julia Raskin, Text 1 clearly states that Jamie doesn't know his mom's name. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that Jamie is specifically looking for Julia Raskin, as he doesn't know this name. The hypothesis in Text 2 contradicts the information provided in Text 1 about Jamie not knowing his mom's name."
