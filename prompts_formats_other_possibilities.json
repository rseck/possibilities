  "Task: Rephrase Text 1 to Alter the Answer to a Multiple-Choice Question\n\nYou are given a premise (Text 1) and a hypothesis (Text 2), and asked to determine the relationship between the two texts by selecting one of three options: entailment, neutral, or contradiction.\n\nInstructions:\nStep 1: Answer the Original Question\nRead both Text 1 (premise) and Text 2 (hypothesis).\nThen, answer the question: \"What is the relationship between Text 1 and Text 2?\"\n\nThe possible answers are:\nEntailment: Text 1 logically implies Text 2.\nNeutral: Text 1 and Text 2 are unrelated, neither supporting nor contradicting each other.\nContradiction: Text 1 contradicts Text 2.\nStep 2: Modify Text 1 to Change the Answer\n\nAfter determining the original relationship, rephrase or modify elements of Text 1 to change the answer to one of the other two options.\nFor each of the other two possible answers (entailment, neutral, contradiction) Identify what needs to be changed in Text 1 to achieve the alternative relationship.
