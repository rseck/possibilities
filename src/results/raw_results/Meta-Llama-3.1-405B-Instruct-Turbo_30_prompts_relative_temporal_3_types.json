            "model_reply": "The answer is: True.\n\nThe premise states that the future sole survivor of the tribe is in the tribe for this tribal council and that everybody can be voted out. This implies that the future sole survivor is also at risk of being voted out. Therefore, the hypothesis that the sole survivor can be voted out of the tribe in this tribal council is supported by the premise."
